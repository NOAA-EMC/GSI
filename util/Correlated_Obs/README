cov_calc computes satellite observation error covariances. 
This utility does not yet handle all-sky instruments entirely correctly. 
There are two methods available to compute inter-channel error covariances, namely Desroziers' method and the Hollingsworth-Lonnberg method.

This program uses the radstat.gdas.$date files, and outputs up to four binary files.
The first binary file contains the covariance matrix (plus extra information about the matrix), which can readily be used in the GSI.
Outputting the other files is optional.
They contain the wavenumbers of the satellite instrument active channels, the obs errors from the diagonal of the covariance matrix, and the error correlation matrix.

To use the computed covariance matrix in the GSI:
1.  Add a table to the anavinfo file, following the comments in src/gsi/correlated_obsmod.F90.
2.  Copy the covariance matrix into the fix directory.  Make sure the run script will copy the covariance file from the fix directory to the run directory. It should contain something like  'cp $FIXgsi/Rcov* $DATA'

This utility compiles with cmake.
To compile, set BUILD_COV_CALC in ../../CMakeLists.txt to ON and then run ../../ush/build_all_cmake.sh. 
This will create the executable ../../exec/cov_calc

There are two ways to run cov_calc. The bottleneck of this program is in dealing with the radstat files.
The radstat files can be either binary or netcdf.
Using parallel_run.sh will process the radstat files in parallel. 
To use this script, edit its first few lines, and then simply run it.
Both run.sh and parallel_run.sh contain options to specify which computational method to use (Desroziers or Hollingsworth-Lonnberg)
a choice to use only actively assimialted channels (recommended for Desrioziers) or all channels, reconditioning options and surface options.

If the amount of radstat files is small, or they have already been processed (see below), then run.sh can be used.
Edit its first few lines and submit submit_hera.sh or submit_wcoss.sh as a job. 

cov_calc requires the files diag_$instr_anl.$date and diag_$instr_ges.$date from the radstat files.
The first analysis diag file must be renamed danl_0001, the second renamed danl_0002, etc, while the first background file must be renamed dges_0001 and so on.
Even if a diag file is missing, the danl and dges files count up by one each time.  
The scripts parallel_run.sh and run.sh process the radstat files in this manner.  

This program includes options to recondition the covariance matrix.  
The method is specified in the first few lines of parallel_run.sh or run.sh.  
To recondtion, kreq (desired condition number) must be positive, and to not recondition, kreq must be negative. 
The two methods for reconditioning are the second method described in Weston's paper (source 1 below) 
and the trace norm method (source 2 below, this method is actually equivalent to the first method mention in Weston's paper).  
The trace norm method is used in operations.
Note that for the trace norm method, kreq must be at least as large as the number of eigenvalues that are smaller than lambda_max/kreq.  
It is safest to take kreq to be equal to the number of actively assimilate channels.  
The program will automatically redefine kreq if needed, but it will increase (conditioning becomes worse). 
There are also options to apply channel-dependent variance inflation.

The matlab program plotcovs.m can plot IASI and CrIS correlation matrices and observation errors. 
To use this program, output the correlation matrix and observation errors when running cov_calc.
It will not work if changes are made to channel selection. 
If channel selection does change, plotcovs.m can be made to work by commenting out lines that 
set gca values for X and Y values (for example set(gca,'XTick',xt)) and the line that plots err (original satinfo errors).
