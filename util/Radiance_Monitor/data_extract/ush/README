Radiance Monitor, data_extract scripts


The scripts in this directory are used to set up the environments, run the 
appropriate executables, and move the resulting data and log files to the 
desired directories.

The scripts named in "camel case" (mixed case) may be called directly.  Those
named entirely in lower case are utility scripts which are used by the 
camel case scripts; they should not be called directly by the user.

There are two sets of scripts; one for the global, and one for the
regional.  They are similar, but not identical in function.  

The top level scripts are VrfyRad_glbl.sh and VrfyRad_rgnl.sh scripts.
They poll for new diagnostic files and, if a new diag file is found, they 
submit ../nwprod/jobs/JGDAS_VRFYRAD.sms.prod to peform the data extraction 
and optional data validation.  

IMPORTANT:  When running the package from the command line the 
$RADSTAT_LOCATION should be set to the location of your radstat files.
This is in parm/RadMon_user_settings, or it can be exported in your shell
script environment and the package will use that value in preference
to the setting in /parm/RadMon_user_settings.

This is an example of a command line call to VrfyRad_glbl.sh:

  >  ./VrfyRad_glbl.sh mysfx 2013060712

In this example "mysfx" is the suffix or name given to a specific data set.  
The date [yyyymmddhh] is an optional argument which specifies exactly which
cycle is to be processed.  If no cycle is specified, the package will 
scan the TANKDIR/stats/mysfx directory and determine the last cycle processed,
add 6 hrs to that, and attempt to process that cycle.  When running the data
extraction for a new source, provide a date argument for your first cycle.

The resulting data files from the data extraction step are saved in 
$TANKDIR/stats/${SUFFIX} and $TANKDIR/stats/regional/${SUFFIX} directories.   $TANKDIR is 
defined within the *_conf files in the parm directory. 


There is one other top level script, RunVrfy.sh, which may be used as a batch 
processor.  It can be used to process data for a given suffix (source) in 3 
ways:

  1.  Between explicit starting and ending dates.
  2.  From a specified starting date until it runs out of data.
  3.  From the last date processed in the $TANKDIR/stats/$SUFFIX directory
      until it runs out of data. 

The calling sequence is > RunVrfy.sh suffix [start date] [end date].


The MkBase.sh script is used to create the base history files which are
used by the data validation reports.  If you do not wish to turn on data error
reporting (generally only needed for operational data, not experimental
parallels), then this script won't need to be run.

The MkCtl_glbl.sh and MkCtl_rgnl.sh scripts are utility scripts that 
generate the control files for a given suffix (source).  The control files
are created by default during normal data extraction, and the are used to
by the image generation scripts. Unless you wish to modify the defaults, 
these scripts won't need to be run.

See the README in the parms directory for default settings information.
