The RadMon package can be configured for your particular data source by 
modifying the RadMon_user_settings script in this directory, or by overriding
specific entries in that script within your interactive shell.  

Similarly package configuration changes can be made by modifying individual 
values in the RadMon_config script in this directory, or by overriding 
specific entries in that script within your interactive shell.

If you have not done so already, please run the RadMon_install.sh script 
located in the directory one level from here.  RadMon_install.sh will update 
the RadMon_config and RadMon_user_settings files and set some defaults based 
on the system you're running on (wcoss_c|d or hera). It will also run the 
makeall.sh script which will build all the necessary executables and move 
them to the appropriate exec directories within the package.
