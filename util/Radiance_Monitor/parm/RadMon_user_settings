#
#  ACCOUNT is used on zeus only for use with the qsub -a flag.  It is
#  empty on other platforms.
#
export ACCOUNT=${ACCOUNT:-}

#
#  PROJECT is used on wcoss only with the bjob -P flag.  It is 
#  empty on other platforms.
#
export PROJECT=${PROJECT:-GDAS-T2O}

#
#  JOB_QUEUE is used on wcoss only with the bjob -q flag.  It is 
#  empty on other platforms.
#
export JOB_QUEUE=${JOB_QUEUE:-dev_shared}

#
#  RAD_AREA is either glb (global) or rgn (regional)
#
export RAD_AREA=${RAD_AREA:-glb}

#
#  RADSTAT_LOCATION is location of the radstat files.  If RadMon runs as a 
#    job in a parallel then $COMOUT is used instead of the value defined below.  
#    When plotting, if horizontal plots are desired then RADSTAT_LOCATION will
#    need to be set to the directory of the radstat files (we only extract 
#    horizontal data when it's needed rather than storing huge files all the time).
#
export RADSTAT_LOCATION=${RADSTAT_LOCATION:-/com/gfs/prod}

#
#  USE_ANL switches on/off data extraction for analysis files (ges is always on)
#    0 = off, 1 = on
#
export USE_ANL=${USE_ANL:-1}

#
#  PLOT_ALL_REGIONS switches on/off plotting of all 5 regions (global, land, 
#    water, ice/snow, mixed).   0 = off, 1 = on
#
export PLOT_ALL_REGIONS=${PLOT_ALL_REGIONS:-1}

#
#  PLOT_SUB_AVGS switches on/off plotting of subset averages in certain plots,
#    such as the 7 day avgs in the summary plots.  0 = off, 1 = on
export PLOT_SUB_AVGS=${PLOT_SUB_AVGS:-1}

#
#  PLOT_HORIZ switches on/off plotting of horizontal data.  0=off, 1 = on.
#
export PLOT_HORIZ=${PLOT_HORIZ:-0}

#
#  PLOT_STATIC_IMGS switches on/off generation of static summary image plots.
#     Image plotting is moving towards client browser drawn images and plotting
#     scripts will eventually not "plot" images, but rather generate very small
#     text files used to draw these client browser images.  The reason for this
#     change is that the browswer drawn images can be modified dynamically by the
#     user, and the text files require less server space than static images.
#
#     At present only summary plots have been converted.  
#     0 = no static summary plot images created, 1 = static summary plots are generated
#
export PLOT_STATIC_IMGS=${PLOT_STATIC_IMGS:-0}

#
#  USE_TM is only used for regional data sources and by default uses the tm12
#  files.  
export USE_TM=${USE_TM:-tm12}

#
#  DO_ARCHIVE switches on archiving of extracted data files.  This is generally
#    used for the operational data sets (GDAS, NDAS) and isn't normally necessary
#    for parallels.  0 = off, 1 = on
export DO_ARCHIVE=${DO_ARCHIVE:-0}
export ARCHIVE_DIR=${ARCHIVE_DIR:-' '}

#
#  HPSS_DIR is the location for archived data on the hpss.  It will only
#    be used if DO_ARCHIVE is set to on (1).
export HPSS_DIR=${HPSS_DIR:-' '}

#
#  STATIC_SATYPE switches on/off use of static satype list.  This is primarily
#    intended for use with diagnotic file error reporting and isn't needed 
#    for most parallels.  0 = off, 1 = on
export STATIC_SATYPE=${STATIC_SATYPE:-0}

#
#  DO_DIAG_RPT switches on/off the diagnostic error reporting.  This is check
#    primarily intended for use with the operational data sets (GDAS,NDAS) where
#    detection and reporting of a missing sat/instrument source in a given cycle run
#    is desirable.  It is not normally necessary in parallels.  0 = off, 1 = on
export DO_DIAG_RPT=${DO_DIAG_RPT:-0}

#  DO_DATA_RPT switches on/off error checking and reporting of the penalty values
#    by channel for each sat/instrument source.  This is a check primarily intended
#    for use iwth the operational data sets (GDAS,NDAS) where detection and 
#    reporting of drifting channel(s) on specific sat/instrument sources is 
#    desirable.  It is not normally necesary to apply this to parallels.  0 = off, 1 = on
export DO_DATA_RPT=${DO_DATA_RPT:-0}
export MAIL_TO=${MAIL_TO:-' '}
export MAIL_CC=${MAIL_CC:-' '}

#
#  RUN_ONLY_ON_DEV switches on/off the constraint to run only on the development machine.
#  0 = prod or dev, 1 = dev only.
#  
export RUN_ONLY_ON_DEV=${RUN_ONLY_ON_DEV:-1}

#
#  KEEPDATA switches on/off allowing the work directory to remain after data extraction.
#  YES=keep working directory, NO=rm working directory.
#
export KEEPDATA=${KEEPDATA:-"YES"}

#
#  REGIONAL_RR flags the data source as a regional rapid refresh.  The output data files
#  from these sources are identified in a different format from other data sources.  
#  0 = not a RR source, 1 = RR source
export REGIONAL_RR=${REGIONAL_RR:-0}

#
#  CYCLE_INTERVAL indicates the period of time between cycle runs for any given
#  data source.  This is generally 6 hrs, but can be 3 or 1 hr for rapid refresh sources.
#
export CYCLE_INTERVAL=${CYCLE_INTERVAL:-6}
