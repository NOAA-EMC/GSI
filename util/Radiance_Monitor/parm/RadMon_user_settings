#  RAD_AREA is either glb (global) or rgn (regional)

#
#  RADSTAT_LOCATION is location of the radstat files.  If RadMon runs as a 
#    job in a parallel then $COMOUT is used instead of the value defined below.  
#    When plotting, if horizontal plots are desired then RADSTAT_LOCATION will
#    need to be set to the directory of the radstat files (we only extract 
#    horizontal data when it's needed rather than storing huge files all the time).
#
export RADSTAT_LOCATION=${RADSTAT_LOCATION:-/gpfs/dell1/nco/ops/com/gfs/prod}

#
#  USE_ANL switches on/off data extraction for analysis files (ges is always on)
#    0 = off, 1 = on
#
export USE_ANL=${USE_ANL:-1}

#
#  PLOT_ALL_REGIONS switches on/off plotting of all 5 regions (global, land, 
#    water, ice/snow, mixed).   0 = off, 1 = on
#
export PLOT_ALL_REGIONS=${PLOT_ALL_REGIONS:-1}

#
#  PLOT_SUB_AVGS switches on/off plotting of subset averages in certain plots,
#    such as the 7 day avgs in the summary plots.  0 = off, 1 = on
export PLOT_SUB_AVGS=${PLOT_SUB_AVGS:-1}

#
#  PLOT_STATIC_IMGS switches on/off generation of static summary image plots.
#     Image plotting is moving towards client browser drawn images and plotting
#     scripts will eventually not "plot" images, but rather generate very small
#     text files used to draw these client browser images.  The reason for this
#     change is that the browswer drawn images can be modified dynamically by the
#     user, and the text files require less server space than static images.
#
#     At present only summary plots have been converted.  
#     0 = no static summary plot images created, 1 = static summary plots are generated

#  files.

#
#  USE_STATIC_SATYPE switches on/off use of static satype list.  This is primarily
#    intended for use with diagnotic file error reporting and isn't needed 
#    for most parallels.  0 = off, 1 = on
export USE_STATIC_SATYPE=${USE_STATIC_SATYPE:-1}

#
#  DO_DIAG_RPT switches on/off the diagnostic error reporting.  This is check
#    primarily intended for use with the operational data sets (GDAS,NDAS) where
#    detection and reporting of a missing sat/instrument source in a given cycle run
#    is desirable.  It is not normally necessary in parallels.  0 = off, 1 = on
export DO_DIAG_RPT=${DO_DIAG_RPT:-1}


#  DO_DATA_RPT switches on/off error checking and reporting of the penalty values
#    by channel for each sat/instrument source.  This is a check primarily intended
#    for use iwth the operational data sets (GDAS,NDAS) where detection and 
#    reporting of drifting channel(s) on specific sat/instrument sources is 
#    desirable.  It is not normally necesary to apply this to parallels.  0 = off, 1 = on
