README RadMon package 

The RadMon (radiance monitoring) package can be used to extract certain information
from radiance diagnostic files and visualize the results by plotting the data using
GrADS.  The package also may optionally perform data validation and error checking
and report problems using email.  The package can run on the ccs, wcoss, or zeus 
machines.

The package is organized in two main pieces, the data_extract and image_gen.  There
is also an nwprod directory, which contains the major components of the 
data_extract portion.  (Part of the data extract has been submitted to OPS for 
so that it may run as part of each cycle.  This was a subset of what is now in the 
nwprod directory, which reflects the required opporational organization.)  

The parm directory contains configuration files used by the entire package.
The data_extract and image_gen directories also have parm diretories,
containing configuration files specific to the data extraction and image generation
functions.

In order to get the package running you must peform these steps:


1.  Run the RadMon_install.pl script.  This will determine which machine you are
working on and adjust the top level parm files as necessary.  It will set the location 
for the TANKDIR, which is the location where RadMon data files and generated images 
are stored.  The default location may accepted or overridden.  It also asks for the 
web server name (emcrzdm is the default), your user name on it, and the desired 
location of the site for your images.  This information is all stored in the 
parm/RadMon_config script.  If you wish to change settings later you can either edit 
the parm/RadMon_config directly or re-run the RadMon_install.pl script.  The 
RadMon_install.pl script also runs the makeall.sh script to build all executables in 
the package.

2.  Run the data extraction to create the binary data files.  This can be done any time 
after the diagnostic file is created.  There are two ways to run the data extraction.  
In RadMon/data_extract/ush/ there are two scripts named VrfyRad_glbl.sh and 
VrfyRad_rgnl.sh.  These can be run from a cron or command line.  They function by 
setting up the environment variables to run RadMon/nwprod/jobs/JGDAS_VRFYRAD.sms.prod. 

Alternately the JGDAS_VRFYRAD.sms.prod job can be included in the vrfy.sh step in your 
parallel.  Instructions for this are included on the GSI trac page's wiki.

3.  Go to the RadMon/image_gen/html directory and run Install_html.sh.  This will build
the web site using the web settings specified in step 2, and the available 
satellite/instrument sources from step 3.

4.  Run the image generation.  This can be done after the binary files are created.  In
RadMon/image_gen/ush there are two scripts, CkPlt_glbl.sh and CkPlt_rgnl.sh.  These can
be run from the command line or as a cron.  They create the images using GrADS and 
move them to the $TANKDIR/imgn directory.  A third script, Plot.sh, is also available.
It takes as input a specific start and stop date/cycle so it can be used to plot a 
specific interval.

5.  If moving files from the CCS to the web server the image_gen/ush/Transfer.sh script 
may be used.  It uses rsync to mirror the $TANKDIR/imgn/$suffix directory to the target 
directory on the web server.

If moving files from zeus to emcrzdm, you need to manually move them first to the CCS and 
then to the web server.  Zeus only allows file pulls, and emcrzdm is configured to 
allow pushes only, and does not permit allow logins to other systems.
