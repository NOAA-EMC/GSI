Radiance Monitor, image_gen scripts

The scripts in this directory are used to generate images for specified 
data sources using the data files created by the data_extract portion of this
package. 

The scripts named in "camel case" (mixed case) may be called directly.  Those
named entirely in lower case are utility scripts which are used by the 
camel case scripts; they should not be called directly by the user.

There are two sets of scripts; one for the global, and one for the
regional.  They are similar, but not identical in function.  

The top level scripts are RadMon_IG_glb.sh and RadMon_IG_rgn.sh scripts.  This is 
and example of running them from the command line:

>  ./RadMon_IG_glb.sh mysfx --pdate 2020123100

The "mysfx" is the identifying suffix.  This must match data processed by the
data_extract scripts, which should be in your $TANKDIR/stats/$SUFFIX directory.  
The date is optional.  If provided, the plot will be run with for this cycle 
(using a 30 day period ending with this cycle).  If no date is provided the 
last cycle processed will be used for the plot.

Assuming data is available and the top level plot scripts run the lower level 
scripts to set up the environement, move data and control files into work 
directories.  The plot scripts now produce small .txt files which are used by
the javascript within the several .html files to generate interactive images.  
The plotting scripts may optionally use GrADS to produce static images.  To make this 
happen set PLOT_STATIC_IMGS=1 in the  RadMon/parm/RadMon_user_settings file.
The output image files (.txt, .png) are then moved to the $TANKDIR/imgn/$SUFFIX/pngs 
directory. 

FILE TRANSFERS:  
==== =========

Previous versions of this package used secure copy (scp) to push image files to 
the web server.  The scp command has enough overhead though that the large number
of transfers that the package performs can slow the web server.  To prevent server
slowdowns rsync is now used instead of scp.

The plot_* scripts move the image files to the $IMGNDIR directory.  The default 
location for this is ~/nbns/imgn/$SUFFIX/$RUN/radmon/pngs (SUFFIX is the data
source identifier, such as mysfx, run is generally gdas|gfs).  The rsync utility 
can then be used to mirror the files in the $IMGNDIR to the web server's pngs directory.  

The Transfer.sh script is automatically started by the plot script if $RUN_TRANSFER 
in parm/RadMon_user_settings is set to 1.  The Transfer.sh script can also be run
via cron or at the command line, though it's best to do this as a job submitted to
the dev_transfer queue. 

Please note that scripted file transfers generally cannot be done from hera to the
web server.  If you need to move files from hera you will have to resort to tarring them
up and moving them manually.  You may be able to convince the hera admins to allow an
automated transfer but you will have to take that up with them.
