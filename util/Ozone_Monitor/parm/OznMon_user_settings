#  OZNSTAT_LOCATION is location of the radstat files.  If OznMon runs as a 
#    job in a parallel then $COMOUT is used instead of the value defined below. 
#    When plotting, if horizontal plots are desired then OZNSTAT_LOCATION will
#    need to be set to the directory of the radstat files (we only extract 
#    horizontal data when it's needed rather than storing huge files all the 
#    time).
#

#

#
#  OZN_USE_RUN affects the data, image, and log file naming scheme, and is 
#  designed to support both gdas and gfs runs for a common data source.
#  (Note, lcm means lower case monitor name ("oznmon".) 
#
#  If set to 1 (default) then storage is :
#      nbns/stats/$suffix/$RUN.$pdy/$lcm
#      nbns/imgn/$suffix/$RUN/$lcm/pngs  
#      $LOGdir/$suffix/$RUN/$lcm
#
#  set to #  0 then the resulting storage locations are:
#      nbns/data/$suffix/$lcm.$PDY
#      nbns/imgn/$suffix/$lcm/pngs
#      $LOGdir/$suffix/$lcm
#
#  $RUN is "gdas"|"gfs" or whatever else makes sense for a RUN value.
#
export OZN_USE_RUN=${OZN_USE_RUN:-1}

#  DO_DATA_RPT switches on/off error checking and reporting of the penalty 
#  values by channel for each sat/instrument source plus a check for any 
#  missing (but expected) data sources.  This is primarily intended for use
#  with the operational data sets (GDAS,NDAS) where detection and reporting 
#  of drifting channel(s) on specific sat/instrument sources is 
#  desirable.  It is not normally necesary to apply this to parallels.  
#  0 = off, 1 = on

#  RUN_ONLY_ON_DEV switches on/off the constraint to run only on the

#  KEEPDATA switches on/off allowing the work directory to remain after data 
#  extraction.
#
#  1=keep working directory, 0=rm working directory.
#
export KEEPDATA=${KEEPDATA:-1}

#
#  REGIONAL_RR flags the data source as a regional rapid refresh.  The output 
#  data files from these sources are identified in a different format from 
#  other data sources.  
#
#  0 = not a RR source, 1 = RR source
#
export REGIONAL_RR=${REGIONAL_RR:-0}

#
#  CYCLE_INTERVAL indicates the period of time between cycle runs for any given
#  data source.  This is generally 6 hrs, but can be 3 or 1 hr for rapid 
#  refresh sources.
