This Matlab package will plot a fit2obs scorecard from the /noscrub/archive/exp/fits/fit* files
between an experiment and a control.

To run this package, first load the latest Matlab module
module load matlab
Note that the default is not always the latest version. Matlab is only available on Hera, and therefore
this package will not run on WCOSS.

Next, extract data from fits files.  Edit the first few lines of run_extract.sh, and then run this program.
This program will handle missing fit files correctly.

Next, edit fdir in fit_plots.m to be equal to wrkdir in run_extract.sh.  Edit the variable 'pngname', to change 
the name of the outputted png files.  

Bring up the Matlab GUI.  Enter the command matlab.  Once the GUI has fully loaded, enter the command fit_plots 
and wait several minutes for the images to appear.  An improvement (Imp) is an improvement in the experiment over
the control (as defined in run_extract.sh), while a degradation (Deg) is a degradation in the experiment over 
the control. Images will automatically be saved.

Warning messages about disabled graphics on the Matlab GUI are normal.

By default, this will only make scorecards for radiosonde fits. It is possible to make scorecards for aircraft and surface fits. 
Uncomment the hmap_plots and acft_plots lines at the end of fit_plots.m as desired.

It is possible to edit fit_plots to make other plots that are similar to fit2obs plots.  Set ex=1, and then
search for (ex>0) in fit_plots.m.  Follow the examples and comments here to make your own plots.
