wgrib2 is a program to read/write grib2 files.


For documentation, see

    http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/wesley/wgrib2/index.html


For documentation of commonly used program options, type

    wgrib2


For documentation of all program options, type

   wgrib2 -help all

For documenation of any program option that is poorly described on-line
or by the "wgrib2 -help all", check the source code by searching
for "f_{option}" where the option does not include the minus sign.


Default makefile options

      USE_NETCDF4=0
      USE_NETCDF3=1
      USE_REGEX=1
      USE_TIGGE=1
      USE_MYSQL=0
      USE_IPOLATES=0

To compile without netcdf, use USE_NETCDF3=0 and USE_NETCDF4=0
To compile without netcdf v3, set USE_NETCDF3=1 and USE_NETCDF4=0
To compile without netcdf v4, set USE_NETCDF3=0 and USE_NETCDF4=1
 For netcdf4, the netcdf4 and hdf5 libraries are usually not included 
  in the wgrib2.tgz file to save space.

If you have an old C compiler system that doesn't include <regex.h>, then
you have to set USE_REGEX=0.  This turns off all the regular expressions
which would be a pain.

No harm to keep TIGGE support on.  USE_TIGGE=1

Support for Mysql is an option.  You have to modify the makefile to indicate 
the locations of the mysql includes and libraries and set USE_MYSQL=1

The option -new_grid uses the ipolates library to do the interpolation.
The required libraries are written in fortran and their is no support
for compiling these libraries.  The source code and makefile will
have to be modified to use the ipolates option.  Consult a local
expert if you want to install this optional package.  No help is available 
from NCEP for installing the package.
