This directory contains a number of utilities that may be used to analyse the 
performance of the GDAS.  Please add your favorite routines to this!

The util/ directory is split into Radiance_Utilities/ which primarily display 
information in the radiance diagnostic files (diag_*) and the 
Analysis_Utilities/ which are used to display the analysis, surface and 
forecast fields .

At the next level in the directory structure, there are subdirectories 
describing the programming language used e.g.,  Fortran, IDL, GRads, NCAR.

The next level contains the individual packages. 

Currently, the contents are:

Radiance_Utilities/Fortran/RadDiag_Stats:   
             This is a package that reads in the radiance diag files for a
             given instrument for multiple cycles and outputs statistics in
             netCDF format for future display.  For each channel statistics 
             may be produced as a function of time, scan angle, and 
             latitude/longitude (2D) as well as the aggregated stats. 

Radiance_Monitor/data_extract:
             Scripts and source code used to extract radiance monitoring
             data from diagnostic files and save into small binary files.
             These binary files can be processed by the scripts in the
             image_gen directory to produce radiance monitoring graphics.
             See the src directory for a script to build all the necessary
             executables for the Radiance Monitor package.  Can process both
             GDAS (global) and NDAS (regional) data sources.

                /image_gen:
             Shell and GrADS scripts, and source code needed to generate images
             using the binary data files produced by the data_extract scripts
             and programs (see above).  Can only process GDAS (global) data at
             present.

Radiance_Utilities/IDL/RadDiag_Stats: 
             Contains routine to plot the netCDF files produced above

Radiance_Utilities/IDL/Diag_Reader: 
             Reads in radiance diag files directly into IDL structures.  Good
             for more detailed investigation of radiances on an ob-by-ob basis.

Radiance_Utilities/diag2grads:
             Reads radiance diag files for a given instrument and outputs a
             GrADS binary data file and control file

Analysis_Utilities/GrADS:
             Scripts for displaying analysis fields in GrADS.  Currently
             contains diffvarsloop.gs and diffvarsloop4.gs which display
             differences in analysis or forecast fields and differences of
             those differences.

Radiance_bias_correction_Utilities:
             Utilities for converting bias correction files to the new format, 
             since the modified bias correction scheme requires changes to the 
             satbias_in and satbias_angle files.

global_angupdate:
             Updates the angle dependent part of the radiance bias correction
