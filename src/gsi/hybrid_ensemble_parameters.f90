! abstract: contains parameters which define the details of the
!             hybrid 3dvar ensemble option.
!   the following is a brief description of the hybrid 3dvar ensemble option:
!=====================================================================================================
!initial documentation for hybrid ensemble option (2009-12-16):
!
!  Only implemented for 3dvar full B version of GSI.  Future extension to sqrt(B) and 4dvar will
!   require collaboration with GMAO.  As long as hybrid ensemble option is turned off, 4dvar option
!   should still work.  This is an initial working formulation.  It is expected that many changes
!   will be made over the next several years.
!
! This formulation is based on 
!    Wang, X.,  D. M. Barker, C. Snyder, and T. M. Hamill, 2008:  A Hybrid ETKF.3DVAR 
!	Data Assimilation Scheme for the WRF Model.  Part I: Observing System 
!	Simulation Experiment.  Mon. Wea. Rev., 136, 5116-5131.
!
!  only difference is that preconditioning is based on full B instead of sqrt(B):
!
!  To introduce ensemble information into the background, a new control variable a (a_en in code), with
!    corresponding background error A, is added to the cost function.
!
!       J(x1,a) = .5*x1_trans*Bs_inv*x1 + .5*a_trans*Ae_inv*a + Jo(x,yobs)
!
!   where Bs is the weighted static background error covariance and
!         Ae is the weighted ensemble amplitude localization covariance.
!
!   Bs = diag(sqrt(beta_s)*B*diag(sqrt(beta_s)
!
!   Ae = diag(sqrt(beta_e)*A*diag(sqrt(beta_e)
!
!   beta_s and beta_e are currently allowed to vary in the vertical.
!
!   The 1st version of the hybrid ensemble code had beta_s, beta_e a single
!   constant, with the constraint 
!     
!        0 <= beta_s <= 1 , and  beta_e = 1 - beta_s
!
!   Now, vertical profiles of beta_s, beta_e are read in from file beta_profile
!    If file beta_profile is not available, then beta_s = beta_s0 and beta_e = 1 - beta_s0
!
!  The state variable x is recovered from the control variable pair (x1,a) using
!
!         x = L*(x1 + sum(n=1,n_ensemble (a(n) o x_ensemble(n)))  
!
!          where L is tlnmc or identity.
!
!                x_ensemble(n)  are n_ensemble sets of ensemble perturbations
!
!            and x o y is elementwise (Shur) product
!
!          Each a(n) is technically the same length as x_ensemble(n), but in practice
!            the actual stored size is one 3D grid.
!
!   Conversion from x1,a to x is implemented by  subroutine ensemble_forward_model, 
!                located in file hybrid_ensemble_isotropic.f90
!
!
!  A = diag(S,S,...,S) is a block diagonal matrix, and each S is a correlation matrix, applied
!  identically to each a(n).  In the current version, S is implemented using recursive filters
!  in horizontal and vertical (spectral in horizontal for global application).
!
!  Full background precondioning is used:
!
!         x1 = Bs*y1
!
!         a  = Ae*b
!
!  The resulting cost function:
!
!       J = .5*x1_trans*y1 + .5*a_trans*b  + Jo(x,yobs)
!
!   How to control the hybrid ensemble option:
!
!   NAMELIST HYBRID_ENSEMBLE:
!
!      l_hyb_ens:  logical variable, if .true., then turn on hybrid ensemble option, default = .false. 
!      n_ens:      ensemble size, default = 0
!      nlon_ens            - number of longitudes to use for ensemble members and ensemble control vector
!      nlat_ens            - number of latitudes to use for ensemble members and ensemble control vector
!      beta_s0:    value between 0 and 1, default = 1.0, 
!                  relative weight given to static background B when (readin_beta=.false.)
!                  when (readin_beta=.true.), the vertical weighting parameters are read from a file,
!                  instead of being defined based on beta_s0 namelist or default value. 
!      beta_e0 - default weight given to ensemble background error covariance
!                (if .not. readin_beta). if beta_e0<0, then it is set to
!                1.-beta_s0 (this is the default)
!      s_ens_h:    horizontal localization correlation length (units of km), default = 2828.0
!      s_ens_v:    vertical localization correlation length (grid units), default = 30.0
!      generate_ens:  if .true., generate ensemble perturbations internally as random samples of background B.
!                       (used primarily for testing/debugging)
!                     if .false., read external ensemble perturbations
!      aniso_a_en: if .true., then allow anisotropic localization correlation (not active yet)
!      uv_hyb_ens: if .true., then ensemble perturbation wind stored as u,v
!                  if .false., ensemble perturbation wind stored as psi,chi.
!                   (this is useful for regional application, where there is ambiguity in how to
!                      define psi,chi from u,v)
!      q_hyb_ens:  if .true., then use specific humidity ensemble perturbations
!                  if .false. (default), use relative humidity
!      readin_localization:  if .true., then read in localization information from external file
!      use_localization_grid: if true, then use extra lower res gaussian grid for horizontal localization
!                                   (global runs only--allows possiblity for non-gaussian ensemble grid)
!      oz_univ_static:  if .true., ozone perturbations are zeroed out to make the ozone analysis
!                       univariate, and defaults back to static B (no ensemble component)
!      eqspace_ensgrid: if .true., then ensemble grid is equal spaced, staggered 1/2 grid unit off
!                               poles.  if .false., then gaussian grid assumed for ensemble (global only)
!      pwgtflg: if true, vertical integration function for ensemble contribution on Psfc
!      full_ensemble: if true, first ensemble member perturbed on first guess
!                    if false, first member perturbed on ensemble mean as the rest of the menbers
!      grid_ratio_ens: ratio of ensemble grid resolution to analysis resolution (default value is 1)
!      vvlocal:  logical variable, if .true., then horizontal localization length
!                function of z, default = .false. 
!      ensemble_path: path to ensemble members; default './'
!      ens_fast_read: read ensemble in parallel; default '.false.'
!      sst_staticB:   if .true. (default) uses only static part of B error covariance for SST

! program history log:
!   2009-09-16  parrish
!   2010-02-20  parrish - add changes to allow dual resolution capability.
!   2010-04-06  parrish - add 2nd option for units of vertical localization:
!                             if s_ens_v < 0, then abs(s_ens_v) is vertical localization length scale in
!                             units of ln(p).  otherwise, when s_ens_v > 0, localization is in vertical
!                             grid units.  The ln(p) distance measurement is approximate, based on a
!                             fixed surface pressure of 1000mb.  This is because at the point where filter
!                             constants are currently generated, the background 3d pressure field is not
!                             yet available.  A later update will correct this.
!                             For the current s_ens_v > 0, the measure is vertical grid units.
!                             s_ens_v = 20 and s_ens_v = -0.44 are roughly comparable, and
!                             connection of .44 is .44 = (sqrt(.15)/sqrt(2))*1.6, where 1.6 is the value used
!                             by Jeff Whitaker for his distance in which the Gaspari-Cohn function 1st = 0.
!   2010-09-25  parrish - add logical parameter gefs_in_regional to signal use gefs for regional hybens.
!   2010-10-13  parrish - add parameter write_ens_sprd to allow option of writing global ensemble spread
!                             in byte addressable format for plotting with grads.
!   2011-09-15  todling - add use_gfs_ens to control when to use other
!   2012-01-17  wu      - add switches and arrays for new options: full_ensemble,pwgtflg
!   2012-01-17  parrish - add integer parameter regional_ensemble_option which currently takes values
!                              1-5.  See def below for details. 
!   2012-02-07  tong    - remove logical parameter gefs_in_regional and reduce regional_ensemble_option
!                         to 4 options.
!   12-05-2012  el akkraoui - revised comments related to change in vertically varying beta weights
!   2013-01-20  parrish - move initialization of beta_s, beta_e, pwgt to after allocation.
!   2013-11-22  kleist  - add option for q perturbations
!   2014-05-14  wu      - add logical variable vvlocal for vertically verying horizontal localization length in regional
!   2015-01-22  Hu      - add flag i_en_perts_io to control reading ensemble perturbation.
!   2015-02-11  Hu      - add flag l_ens_in_diff_time to force GSI hybrid use ensembles not available at analysis time
!   2015-09-18  todling - add sst_staticB to control use of ensemble SST error covariance
